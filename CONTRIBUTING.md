- **Clean, modular, and well-documented code**
- **Proper error handling and edge case management**
- **Consistent naming conventions and code organization**
- **Type hints where applicable (Python 3.6+)**

#### ✅ Project Structure
Each project should follow this structure:
```

├── your_project.pynb                 # Project-specific notebook

```

#### ✅ Documentation Requirements
- **Clear README.md** with project description, setup instructions, and usage examples
- **Inline code comments** explaining complex logic
- **Docstrings** for all functions and classes
- **Technology stack** clearly listed with versions

#### ✅ Technical Standards
- **End-to-end implementation** from data loading to results
- **Production-ready architecture** with proper separation of concerns
- **Reproducible results** with seed settings where applicable
- **Performance considerations** and optimization notes
